### Aloha ðŸ¤™ Klahowya Tillicum ðŸ’™ðŸŒ²ðŸ’š

ðŸš€ Senior Software Engineer | Entrepreneur | GIS & AI Enthusiast | Educator

With over 25 years of experience in software engineering, web development, and digital entrepreneurship, I specialize in building scalable, high-performance applications with JavaScript, React, Node.js, GIS, and AI. My work spans observability, operational effectiveness, and capability maturity modeling, ensuring that teams and systems evolve for long-term success.

Beyond tech, Iâ€™m passionate about data visualization, mapping, and automation, leveraging GIS tools to bring insights to the web. Iâ€™ve co-founded startups, mentored developers, and taught programming at Code Fellows and the University of Washington.

An avid sailor, drone photographer, and SUP racer, I love exploring the Salish Sea while integrating marine navigation, AI, and adventure videography into my projects. Currently, Iâ€™m diving deeper into AI, real estate investing, and building micro-SaaS businesses.
